# LIFT Coach

A dashboard for trainers whose clients use LIFT. Clients send their training and
eating from the app; this collates it into a roster you can read on a Monday
morning and tell at a glance who has gone quiet.

There is no server, no account, and no sign-up — for you or for them.

## How a log gets here

```
client's phone            their email app            your inbox              here
  "Send to Coach"  ──▶  opens pre-filled  ──▶  "LIFT log from …"  ──▶  tap the button
```

The log rides inside the link, in the fragment after the `#`. Browsers never
transmit a fragment to the server, so although this page is served from GitHub
Pages, the training data itself goes phone → mail provider → your browser and
dugcanlift.com never sees it. What lands here stays in this browser's
`localStorage`, on this device.

That also means: **clearing site data deletes your roster.** Connect → *Save a
backup file* exists for exactly that reason.

The wire format is [SHARE-FORMAT.md](SHARE-FORMAT.md), shared by all four
LIFT clients. Change it in one and you change it in four. The backup file the
apps write is a different thing again — that one is
[BACKUP-FORMAT.md](BACKUP-FORMAT.md).

## What it shows

**Roster** — everyone you coach, quietest first, with sessions, sets, volume
against last week, average calories against target, and how often protein
landed. Anyone silent for a week floats to the top with a banner.

**Client** — week-by-week table, training volume, calories and protein against
goal, bodyweight trend, per-lift estimated 1RM progression, and every session
expandable down to the individual set.

**Connect** — the invite to send a client, and backup/restore.

## Setting a client up

Once, per client. Connect → fill in your name and the address logs should come
to → *Copy invite*. They put your address into LIFT's Coach card, and from then
on it is one tap on their end.

A client who reinstalls LIFT gets a new id and arrives as a second person in the
roster. Remove the stale one; the history you already have from them stays.

## Running it locally

Static files, no build. Any web server pointed at the site root works:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Then open `http://localhost:4173/coach/`. The service worker caches the shell,
so bump `CACHE` in `sw.js` whenever a shell file changes or browsers keep
serving the old one.

## Browser support

Decoding a link needs `DecompressionStream`, which means Safari 16.4+, Chrome
103+, or anything newer. Older browsers get a clear message rather than a blank
screen. Senders that lack `CompressionStream` fall back to uncompressed links,
which this reads too.
